<h2>London</h2>
<p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just over 9 million.[9]
   It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, 
   and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[10] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, 
   was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][11] The City of Westminster, 
   to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century,
   [12] the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, 
   Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[13] which largely comprises Greater London,[14] governed by the Greater London Authority</p>
